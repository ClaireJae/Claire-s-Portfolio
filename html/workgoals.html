    <h2>Written by Claire Jaeger</h2>

    <p class="work-goals">I have always been interested and curious about programming, although I never thought it would be something that I would want to do for a living. It wasn't until<br> 
        about 3 years after graduating high school that I decided to go to college. Honestly, I thought college was a waste of money and that it wouldn't work out for me.<br>
        The mindset I was in was very unhealthy and unmotivating, but I'm glad that I became more open-minded to try it out. I have learned so much already and I hope to<br>
        become a software engineer one day.  A software engineer is a person who applies the engineering design process to develop, test, maintain, and evaluate computer<br>
        software. The place I'm interested in working some day is Principal located in Des Moines, Iowa. <br><br></p>

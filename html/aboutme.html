    <h2>Written by Claire Jaeger</h2>
    
    <p>Hello, my name is Claire. I made this website to show off my employability skills. 
        Much of the<br>content is stuff that I've done in my Employability class, 
        and I'm excited to put it into a website!<br>The topics that
        are included in my website are the following:</p>
    <ul id="topics-list">
        <li>Classwork</li>
        <li>College goals</li>
        <li>Work goals</li>
        <li>My resume</li>
    </ul>

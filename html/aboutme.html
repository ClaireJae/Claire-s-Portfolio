    <h2>Written by Claire Jaeger</h2>
    
    <p>Hello, my Name is Claire Jaeger, I'm from Parnell, IA, and I created ths website to show my job skills and to tell you a bit about myself.<br>
        Much of the content is things that I have done and learned in my Employability Skills class. I am excited to put it into a website! The topics<br>
        that are included in my website are the following:</p>
    <ul id="topics-list">
        <li>My Resume</li>
        <li>Contact Information</li>
        <li>My Classwork</li>
        <li>My Work Goals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let me tell you a bit about myself. I have worked at a McDonald's for 4.5 years, 3 of which were as a Shift Manager. I am 21 years old but I have always<br>
    been told that I'm very mature for my age. I surround myself with the right people and I have always been a pretty quiet person. Because of that, I am <br>
    a great listener. Some fun facts about me are: I have 12 pets ranging from hedgehogs to birds to snakes, I have 10 tattoos which are pretty nerdy, I love<br>
    cars and my dream car is an Acura NSX. I currently have a Honda Civic but am in too much debt to it. I also love video games; some of my favorites are <br>
    Pokemon Sword, Minecraft, Story of Seasons, Animal Crossing, and Kirby's Return to Dream Land.</p>

            <p><br>The first 3 projects I have listed here are from my Programming Logic class. In that class, I learned about different<br>
                expressions, data types, structures, and so much more. I was pleasantly surprised when learning how to write pseudocode.<br>
                It was difficult yet interesting and of course kept getting harder, but I was eager to learn new things every day.</p>

            <p>These next 3 projects are from my Employability Skills class. I really enjoyed this class because it allowed me to put my<br>
            skills to the test. I did a mock interview with the instructor and I was very happy with my results. I really do believe this<br>
            class helped me gain confidence for my future job. I can't wait to apply what I learned when the time comes!</p>

            <p>The last 3 projects listed are from my Python class. This class was a bit tough, but I pushed through and studied at every<br>
            chance I got. I chose these pictures because they are some short but great examples of outputs, lists, and a loop. I enjoy the<br>
            more simple statements, but am still looking forward to improving in the future.</p>
